            <h2>
              Simple Defenders
            </h2>
            Simple defenders is a simplistically styled tower defence game. With the help of my team we were able to build this game together. Although the game is unfinished, I am the only team member still working on a fork of the game on github. The biggest challenge was getting the whole team on the same page to work on the project. The best way we found to address the issue is strong communication, and someone to lead the development. I ended up leading the development and many of the towers are based off the Cannon tower I made, and most pushes are from combining everyone's branches.

          Dungeons and Dragons Tax Calculator
        </h2>

          The dungeons and dragons tax calculator (D&D tax calculator). It is a very rudementary calculator mainy as a system to adapt to different architectures. The initial build of the calculator was not directly following an architecture, however there are 4 other architectures. The microservice architecture is the best built I think, the others are not as impressive. For this project I worked with a team (3 people total) to deliver the architectures of the systems. Note there is one static page that will remember you (with cookies) currently online on Github Pages. The biggest challenge in this project was understanding and

            Blackjack App
          </h2>
          <body>
            This app was made with one other person, and we made an app using a free database API and a Room Database. For this assignment we were to make an app that follows an architecture, has a database, and an API. The largest challenge was adhering to the MVVM architectual pattern. I helped my groupmate with the architectual pattern, although much of his code was not folliwing it for the most part.

          Nebulous Enigma
        </h2>
        <body>
          Nebulous Enigma is a choose your own adventure webpage game. As you play you must make choices that lead you down converging or diverging paths. There are many ways to fail and win. I worked with a team of 6 total people to create documentation, diagrams, and the code. The system is not currently hosted, although the game is playable, you must host it yourself. If you would like to look more into it here is the link to the repository (and all of the documentation):
